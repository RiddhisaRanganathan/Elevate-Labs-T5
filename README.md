# Elevate-Labs-T5 - Wireshark Capture

## Methodology
1. Installed and launched Wireshark.
2. Started capturing on the active network interface.
3. Generated network traffic by:
   - Visiting https://www.google.com (HTTPS traffic).
   - Pinging Google's DNS servers 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1 to generate ICMP packets.
4. Stopped the capture after about one minute.
5. Applied filters to isolate safe traffic and saved the filtered capture as a .pcap file.

## Protocols Identified
- **ICMP**: Generated by ping requests/replies to 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1.
- **TLS (HTTPS)**: Encrypted web traffic to google.com on TCP port 443.
- **DNS**: Queries sent to public DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1).
- **OCSPP**: Online Certificate Status Protocol, it is used in TLS to check certificate status.
